# jr0cket Spacemacs configuration

This is an example `~/.spacemacs` file that customises layers and other features of [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/)

It is not meant to be used for your own configuration, rather an example of some of the configuration options you could add to your own `~/.spacemacs` file.

> Much of the configuration I have added to the `dotspacemacs/config` section should probably be in a layer, but I am still learning that bit of Spacemacs.

Thank you
